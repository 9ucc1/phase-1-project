### Objectives
This web app allows users to browse through all Studio Ghibli movies or return a specific movie by searching its title. Users can then add movies of their choice to a watch list, and also remove movies (presumably after watching).

### Technologies
This web app uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on a single page without reloads.
